CONSTRUCTOR =>

         1> constructor can use any access modifier private, protected , public , default as per its use.

         2> Private constructor is used in singleton pattern in which we don't want to create to many
           instance of a class 

for eg : database connectivity,
		 session management,
		 to restrict user and apply filter through getters and setters .
		 

         3> The constructor name should be as of class name and no return statement .

         4> Never create object of same class in constructor because it will cause stack 
           over flow by getting into the loop with no terminating condition.

         5> If we provide any constructor then the compiler will not provide any default constructor .


         6> If their is only Parameterized constructor in super class then sub class also must have parameterized constructor.

         7> If we use super key word in constructor then first super class constructor is called then sub Class constructor is called .

         8> We can not call constructor. it can be called only when the object is created .
