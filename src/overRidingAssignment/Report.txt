OVER-RIDING

while overRiding any function we can not decrease the visibility of inherited method
but we can increase the visibility of inherited method.

Cannot override the final method from SuperClass.

Cannot override static method.

we can have static method with same name in sub and superclass and call them by their reference.

If method is not their we can not override it but new method will be created in that class .

if the method is static then we can call it by superclass and sub class both reference and 
super class and sub class may have same signature static method but sub class hides the super 
class method
